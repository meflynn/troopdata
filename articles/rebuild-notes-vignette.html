</h2>
<p>The bulk of the data included in <code>troopdata</code> versions
under v1.0.0 were drawn from the original Kane data, which was collected
from 1950-2005. The data were then updated through 2020 by Michael A.
Allen, Michael E. Flynn, and Carla Martinez Machain. The data were then
further updated through 2022 by Michael Flynn. Version 1.0.0 marked a
total rebuild of the <code>troopdata</code> package and so many values
may not match up exactly with the original Kane data. Here are a few key
points to note regarding the updates made since v1.0.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The older DoD reports differentiate between forces ashore and
forces afloat, but often have certain afloat forces assigned to a
particular country. In the rebuild the numbers in the data reflect the
total number provided by the DoD—both ashore and afloat—where both are
reported for a given country. Omitting afloat forces attached to a
particular country can severely underestimates the number of personnel
present. In Greece in 1974, for example, we see 3,800 personnel ashore
and a total of 5,437 reported by the DoD as assigned to Greece,
including afloat. We find the same issue in the other countries where
the older data used only ashore and the new data include afloat where
they are permanently assigned to a given country.</p></li>
<li><p>The original reports also contain a category for “other afloat”
that are <strong>not</strong> assigned to particular countries. These
are not aggregated into any country totals in the rebuild. In more
recent years DoD reports list an afloat category for Europe, but don’t
disaggregate those totals by individual country. These values are often
fairly small compared to older values and this may reflect some changes
in accounting for where troops are deployed by the DoD.</p></li>
<li><p>For more recent years some discrepancies between versions might
be the result of the fact that the DoD issued multiple reports with
different figures, even for the same monthly release. For example, There
are multiple reports issued for September 2008 with each reporting
different country-specific values.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also some smaller territorial units that appear in the
DoD reports that did not appear in Kane’s original data or our package.
We create ad hoc country codes to deal with them. Hong Kong, for
example, is treated separately in rebuilt data. This can also factor
into higher regional totals whre Kane’s data may have omitted some of
these smaller territorial units.</p></li>
<li><p>In general we try to assign country codes to deployments that
correspond to their actual physical geographic location. For example,
deployments to Greenland could be assigned to Denmark, but we assign
them to Greenland with an ad hoc country code. Similarly, deployments to
Puerto Rico are assigned to Puerto Rico rather than the United States.
This is a change from the original Kane data, which assigned all
deployments to the United States. These values may be aggregated by
users for analysis if they wish to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>In more recent years the DoD has issued multiple quarterly
reports in a given year. When reporting annual values the
<code><a href="../reference/get_troopdata.html">get_troopdata()</a></code> function will return the highest value from
the quarterly reports for a given year where those are available. This
should only affect more recent years, but it’s a different approach than
Kane’s original method which involved just using the September
reports.</p></li>
<li><p>In some cases the physical location of a deployment may remain
constant but the polity associated with that deployment may change. For
example, deployments to Yugoslavia change to Kosovo in 1999.</p></li>
<li><p>The DoD often lists China and Hong Kong as a single entity. Prior
to 1997 deployments to Hong Kong were usually listed separately, but
following 1997 they are often grouped together. We adopt an ad hoc
country code for Hong Kong and assign deployments to that code where
they are listed as such in the DoD reports. After 1997 we treat any
deployment references to Hong Kong as deployments to China.</p></li>
